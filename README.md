# Honeycomb

We aim to be a self-enabled, independent community of creatives.

---

Honeycomb is a learning experience and an experiment in pushing the boundaries of what co-operative living can be. We're not flower-twirling laggards. We get anxious sitting about, we want to create, we want to have fun. Honeycomb's aim is to be a place for people like us to supplement, while remaining independent of harmful and expensive corporate food and energy practices.
