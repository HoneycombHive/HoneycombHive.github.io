    <h2>The Master Plan</h2>
    <h6>Every good story begins with people</h6>
    <p>Right now we are working to incorporate Honeycomb. The membership model is similar to that of a housing co-operative, where the facility as a whole is incorporated, and members are people that own shares in the co-op. Each member owns their own living space, and all members share the communal duties as well as the utilities, as bound by contract and democracy.</p>
    <p>We are still in the planning stage, so we're not only open to ideas, but we're open to you, as an early adopter. Honeycomb is about people, and with that we need people like you to help us out. We're interested in finding awesome people with skills in things such as engineering, developing, designing, botany, and culinary arts.</p>
